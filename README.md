# Lottery_Randomosity
Can we use Machine Learning models to predict the next winning lottery numbers?

While I had in me hopes the discovery of the ways in which we can predict the outcome of the next billion-dollar winnings, 
I knew that it was more likely that the data would show randomness. Instead, I wanted to show the other side of analysis that is often overlooked in  data science. 
I wanted to highlight the art that can come from a dataset as random as the winning  lottery numbers.
